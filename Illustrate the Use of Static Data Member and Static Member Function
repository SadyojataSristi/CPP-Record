AIM: To illustrate the use of static data members and static member functions in C++.
ALGORITHM:
● Define a class with a static data member.
● Increment the static variable in the constructor.
● Define a static member function to display its value.
● Create multiple objects and call the static function.
● Observe how the static data is shared by all objects.
PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Counter {
static int count; // Static data member
public:
Counter() {
count++;
}
static void showCount() { // Static member function
cout << "Object count = " << count << endl;
}
};
int Counter::count = 0; // Definition outside class
int main() {
Counter c1, c2, c3;
Counter::showCount(); // Access static member function
return 0;
}
