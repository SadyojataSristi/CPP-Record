ALGORITHM:
● Start the program.
● Define a class with data members and member functions.
● Create objects of the class.
● Access data members and member functions using objects.
● Display the output.
● Stop the program.
PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Student {
public:
string name;
int rollNo;
void display() {
cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
cout << "Roll No: " << rollNo << endl;
}
};
int main() {
Student s1; // Object creation
s1.name = "John";
s1.rollNo = 101;
cout << "Student Details:" << endl;
s1.display();
return 0;
}
